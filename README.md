## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

I wanted to get started with a baseline recommendation system that I could refer to everytime. I wanted all information in one place, so I found this amazing kernel in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ibtesama/getting-started-with-a-movie-recommendation-system/data?select=ratings_small.csv) and created this repo. I am planning to enrich this notebook with my findings. 

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook in this repository which includes Demographic Filtering, Content Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. 

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
